## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please create an issue and tag it with the label "security". Alternatively, you can email me at [dev@maxludden.com](mailto:dev@maxludden.com), just include the word "security" in the subject line if you want me to notice it in any reasonable amount of time.
